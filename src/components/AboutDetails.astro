      Welcome! I have a deep appreciation for the intersection of design,
      engineering, and human-computer interaction. Here, I explore what it means
      to be a UX Engineer and researcher, and how we can leverage the blooming
      disciplines of human-centered design and HCI to positively impact the
      rapidly-changing digial world around us.

      Come along with me as I explore this emerging space, build projects, read
      influential research, and expand the educational potential of design and engineering cohesiveness.
