      Welcome! I have a deep appreciation for the intersection of design,
      engineering, and human-computer interaction. Here, I explore what it means
      to be a UX Engineer and researcher, and how we can leverage the blooming
      disciplines of human-centered design and HCI to positively impact the
      rapidly-changing digital world around us.

      I am currently a Masters' student at the Harvard Extension School taking
      courses while working full-time. I will be writing articles about my
      experience being a student and living in the Harvard area, so follow along
      if you're interested in what the journey looks like!
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      Come along with me as I explore this emerging space, build projects, read
      influential research, and expand the educational potential of design and
      engineering cohesiveness.
