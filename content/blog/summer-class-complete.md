# Summer 2023

Howdy! Hard to believe the summer is coming to a close. In this life update post, I detail what I've been up to over the past few months, what I am currently working on and planning for, and what I am excited about for the Fall.

## Summer Class

I just completed my first Harvard Extension School course: [Wearables and Computer Vision (DGMD S-14)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/hidaibarmor/classes/dgmd-s-14-wearable-devices-computer-vision). I will be putting out a full course review regarding specifics on what the course covered and my thoughts as a whole in the coming weeks. However, a brief summary was that I loved my experience in my first HES course, and found the course to be incredibly rewarding. I am able to leave the course having obtained knowledge that I can directly apply to the work I perform at my 9-5, which is a great sign both for my interests in the program and the value of the courses HES offers. There were definitely some long nights with 4 hours of sleep while working full-time, but I came away with an A in the course and a great deal of new found knowledge which is exactly what I was hoping for.

## End of Summer Plans

After taking a bit of time to relax and recover from the busy summer semester, I am taking a bit of vacation time with loved ones to enjoy the last bits of summer sun before the fall semester begins. So looking forward to a mini beach vacay ðŸ˜‚. 

I also recently celebrated by 25th birthdayðŸ¥³! Kinda hard to believe that I'm that old and already more than a year removed from college, but at the same time I am definitely feeling like I am at that stage of maturity and adulthood. I feel ready for the world and more adept and flexible to deal with the many challenges of real life. So I take that as a promising sign haha.

## Fall Semester

This fall, I have the opportunity to enroll in [CSCI-95: Compiler Design and Implementation](https://cscie95.dce.harvard.edu/spring2022/index.html). I am very excited to be taking this class, as it will be the first class I get to take on Harvard's campus, and it's a new area of lower-level computing that I've been interested in for a while. Since my undergraduate education stems from the world of front-end development and UX, I did not end up having the opportunity to do any work with compilers or the C language. The course will definitely be a challenge, and I have been doing some preparing in my free time prior to the course starting, but I am excited and encouraged by this upcoming semester. Dr. Frankel sounds like a great professor, and the feedback from past students has been promising, so I know my efforts will be well worth it.

In parallel, I will also be taking my Critical Reading and Writing Skills Test this fall in order to apply for acceptence as a Software Engineering ALM degree candidate.

Beyond my Masters' progress, I am continuing to work full time, and have been making continued progress in my prowess as a UX Engineer. I have had more opportunities recently to draft wireframes and conduct user elicitation sessions, which I have greatly missed from my undergraduate days. I am also feeling notably more confident in my development skills. TypeScript has evolved into a technology I am confortable with, and I am finding more opportunities to expand my experience with Python as well. This time, coupled with my side efforts to slowly learn Rust and C through my Fall course, are lending well toward shaping me into a more well-rounded engineer.

## Final Thoughts
* For Track and Field fans, the [World Championships](https://worldathletics.org/competitions/world-athletics-championships/budapest23) are going on now!!
* [Million.js](https://million.dev/) is looking pretty cool
* Best of luck to all students going back to school this fall! You've got this!
