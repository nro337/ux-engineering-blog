# Nick's Picks

This post is the first installment of Nick's Picks, a (mostly) weekly post where I list my top picks on technologies and articles around the world of tech that I have found useful, interesting, and topical.

*If you'd like to recommend any selections, don't hesitate to reach out on Twitter [@nickalico](https://www.x.com/nickalico). Always down for community recs!*


## Pick 1: Wedges

 - [MIT License](https://github.com/lmsqueezy/wedges/blob/main/LICENSE)

Wedges is an amazing new design system and component library offered by Lemonsqueezy. The components are built on top of Radix UI, and leverage TailwindCSS for their styling. The platform offers great docks of their components, installation instructions for a number of platforms, and even a free Figma design kit download as well for your design team. They appear to be adding new components very regularly. And best of all, it's open-source!

## Pick 2: Pearl UI

Pearl UI is a new, open-source React Native UI component library created by Rohit Agrawal. Inspired from many of the great aspects of Charkra UI, Pearl UI is packed with a number of useful mobile components that make it very easy to create anything from a quick prototype to a production-ready mobile app. The library also offers Typescript support if you are into that! There are new components being added often, so I definitely wanted to highlight this project as one to keep an eye on as it will no doubt continue to gain popularity in 2024.


## Pick 3: Deptry

Deptry is a really handy Python tool for managing your project dependencies via CLI. Simply run `deptry .` to get a list of unused or conflicting deps. A great tool is you do AI/ML, data science, or write a lot of Python in general! 
* Note that it is recommended to run at the root level of your project while using a virtual environment.

## Pick 4: Rolldown
*[Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/)*

![Rolldown Logo](https://rolldown.rs/rolldown-round.svg)

Rolldown is a speedy new JavaScript bundler written in Rust (because of course it is) aimed at providing faster bundling support. As per their about page, Rolldown aims to be the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), everyone's favorite JS build tool.

Perks include Rollup integration, which makes sense through their mission to help Vite move away from a co-dependence on both esbuild and Rollup. The project is still an active WIP, but it looks like this will assuredly be the next Vite bundler. If you work with bundlers or need to become familar with all-things Vite for the library you run, definitely add this to your weekend reading list.
